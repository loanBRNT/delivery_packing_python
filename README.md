This repository contains code for my participation to the Lychee x Revel Hackaton on Nvidia Isaac-Sim 5.0.0. The idea is to create a prototype for robotic manipulation where an user ask for an order using natural langage. Then two robots collaborates, one is placing all objects on the tray and the other one is transporting the crate.
